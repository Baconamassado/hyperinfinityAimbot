# UI Library by: **CAT_SUS** - Nothing lib

## Script by: **Bacon**

---

### **Loadstring:**

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Baconamassado/hyperinfinityAimbot/refs/heads/main/hyperinfinity.lua"))()
```

## **Hyper Infinity BETA ♾️ - A Universal Aimbot**

---

### **Notes:**

- **Do not modify the loadstring**: Modifying the loadstring will cause the script to **crash** your Roblox **immediately**.
- The script is currently **not working**. I'm actively working to fix it and bring it back online.

---

### **Important:**
- **BETA Version**: This is a beta version of the script, and may not function as expected.
- Please be patient as updates and fixes are in progress.
